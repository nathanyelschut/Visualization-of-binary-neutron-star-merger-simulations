# Visualization-of-binary-neutron-star-merger-simulations
This repository provides the code referred to in my thesis: Visualization of binary neutron-star merger simulations. Included in this repository are the source code for the python package FieldVis that was developed for this thesis as well as example uses and animations. FieldVis is a fast package for creating three dimensional data visualizations built around the package PyVista, designed for visualizing binary neutron-star merger remnant simulations.
